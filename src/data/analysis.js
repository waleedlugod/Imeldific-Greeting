			"The effect of the billboard greeting differs depending on the receiver’s political stance. Those who sided with Leni’s campaign found the billboard to be ludicrous because of the grammatical error found on the billboard. Kakampinks took to Twitter to magnify this careless error and saw this as an opportunity to ridicule the former First Lady. Some tweets even mentioned her graft cases in their “greetings.”",
			"Moreover, a prominent individual also reacted to the electronic billboard. She is Lauren Greenfield, the writer and director of the documentary, “The Kingmaker.” Lauren went to Twitter to express her frustration as the image used in the billboard is owned by the documentary she produced. She claimed that the image was stolen from her and that the billboard violated copyright laws.",
			"On the other hand, Marcos’ supporters did not, in any way, appreciate the billboard greeting. Darryl Yap, a known staunch supporter of the Marcoses, posted on Facebook his opinion about the controversial billboard. He claimed that the billboard was put up by the opposition and that this is their tactic to portray Marcos’ supporters as ignorant. He tried to solidify his theory by pointing out that the image used was from “The Kingmaker,” an anti-Marcos documentary.",
			"It’s hard to tell who really benefited from this billboard greeting. On social media, we can clearly see that this did not favor the Marcoses. But come to think of it, do you think the people who walked along EDSA and saw the billboard even noticed these details? Did the billboard further solidify Imelda’s matriarch image?",
